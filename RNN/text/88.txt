Perhaps it's part of our basic nature to drift into a waking dream state when there are no serious threats on the horizon. Perhaps that's why the universe is constructed as a dangerous universe -- to keep us awake. Maybe God felt it was redundant for the creatures inside his/her/its dream to be dreaming as well. If that's the case, the plan is working, my dream is over. In this dream, I lived in an invulnerable fortress, safe from the misery, ignorance, jealousy, hatred and chaos that surrounded it. I dreamt that the minutiae of my life was important. I dreamt that I could make my little plans. I dreamt that everyone was essentially playing by the same rules. And finally, I dreamt that my dream was reality. Which is why I feel a strange tinge of gratitude bubbling under my grief, fear and rage. I'm grateful to be even a little awake. The way I figure it, this is a miraculous universe, but also a remarkably dangerous one. Sleepwalking is ill-advised.
