I exercise regularly. I eat moderate amounts of healthy food. I
make sure to get plenty of rest. I see my doctor once a year and
my dentist twice a year. I floss every night. I've had chest xâ€“rays, cardio stress tests, EKG's and colonoscopies. I see a
psychologist and have a variety of hobbies to reduce stress. I
don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs. I don't have crazy,
reckless sex with strangers.

If Charlie Sheen outlives me, I'm gonna be really pissed.
