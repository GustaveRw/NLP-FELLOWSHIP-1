As I write this I'm being interviewed by Jeannie McDowell, a reporter for Time magazine. Jeannie's writing an article about comedy on television. She agreed to let me take notes of the interview for my vanity card, but I'm not sure she really knew what a vanity card was. Throughout the Q & A, I try to maintain a mildly-amusing, self-deprecating manner. When asked why TV comedies are struggling these days, I cleverly quip that maybe the problem lies in poor diet or lack of exercise -- but I don't think she writes that down. When she asks about the proliferation of "dramadies," my response is immediate, sharp and insightful. But, neurotically afraid to offend, I hedge my bet by adding that maybe audiences prefer a show that succeeds at being amusing, rather than fails at being funny. I also mention that the media doesn't write treatises about movie comedies sucking because they're not shoved down our throats every week like bad TV shows are. Unfortunately, I can tell that's not a good sound bite -- even for print, which requires, I guess, "print bites." I sense that the interview isn't going well so my mind begins to wander. I imagine a sitcom about a reporter for Time magazine who's interviewing a writer. He's a smart, sexy writer...
