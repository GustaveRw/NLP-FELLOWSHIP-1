If the free press is the enemy of the people, and I'm part of the
people, it would follow that Rachel Maddow is out to get me. Now I
don't mean to diminish her intellect, which is considerable, but as
enemies go, with that Ricky Nelson pompadour and big, goofy grin,
she doesn't exactly strike terror in my heart. On the other hand,
Little Stevie Van Breitbart, who I assume is a friend of the people
and looks like he just woke up from a three-day bender, scares the
$#!+ out of me.
