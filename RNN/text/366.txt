This photograph was my vanity card when I was working
on Grace Under Fire and Cybill. I remember deciding
on its composition by asking myself what were some of
my favorite things. The answer, as you can see in the
picture, was tobacco, bourbon and an old Mac computer.
Eighteen years later, I still love my Mac. The other two
items, despite my eternal affection, have been replaced
with a bronchial inhaler and a metal folding chair in a
church basement.
