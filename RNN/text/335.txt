We tell ourselves stories. We weave together different plot
lines, wondering if the outcome of the story might be different
were we to have done or said something other than what we had done
or said, all the while knowing that the various alternative
outcomes are just more stories - fictions meant to distract us
from what's actually happening. And so we pause from weaving and
commence breathing, gently and non-judgmentally saying hello to
what is...

Oy vey.
