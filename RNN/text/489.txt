I start most of my vanity cards without knowing how to end them. I purposely write myself into a corner and then try to wriggle out of it. Which, I now realize, is the story of my life. Over and over, I have consciously entrapped myself in difficult situations and relationships and then struggled to get free. Which leads me to wonder, is this cycle the very essence of existence? Are we destined to live out an endless, self- imposed drama entitled "stuck, free, stuck, free"? Or, with a bit more flourish, "woe is me, hallelujah, woe is me, hallelujah"? And if this is the case, is life and death just one more variation on the theme? And is it the last? Does the pendulum swinging between entrapment and freedom continue beyond the grave? (Perhaps on a quantum level?) Which poses a new question. If we exist in an eternal loop of suffering and escape, why bother escaping? Why not just embrace the prison we're in? The answer, of course, is that surrender is its own form of freedom. Which is why I've given up on writing my way out of this vanity card. I intend to remain here, happily trapped in a weak premise.
