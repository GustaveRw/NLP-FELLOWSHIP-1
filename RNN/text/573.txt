I'm assuming you've hit pause on your DVR in order to read this.
Thank you. I very much appreciate your interest in my weekly
ramblings. But tonight, rather than indulging myself in witty
pith (pithy wit?), I'd like you to consider the silence caused
by pressing the 'pause' button on your remote. Right now your
world is still. Take a moment to consider that stillness, that
quiet. Allow yourself to enjoy it. Enjoy silence.
