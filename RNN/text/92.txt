HOT, FILTHY SEX! Okay, the truth is I have nothing to back up that first sentence in the way of content. I just thought that since this is a sweeps episode, and traditionally sweeps episodes are supposed to be extremely provocative and highly promotable in order to achieve higher than usual ratings, I'd do my part by writing a vanity card that really grabs your attention (I've also noticed that when the card is broadcast you can only read the first three or four words, so this should raise a few eyebrows). Another tried-and-true element of sweeps episodes is what's called stunt casting. This means that inordinate amounts of money are spent to cast big stars as special guests on the show. Once again, the hoped for result is to pump up the ratings during the specified sweeps period. With that in mind, I'm pleased to announce that JULIA ROBERTS, BRUCE WILLIS, and TOM HANKS were not available for this episode of D & G.
