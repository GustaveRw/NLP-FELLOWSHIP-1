I'm thirteen years old, jammed in the backseat of a Chevy
Impala. My uncle is driving. My aunt is in the passenger seat.
My parents are in the back with me. The four adults are talking
about where they ate last night. This then leads to what they
ate, then to the quality of the food, then to queries about
other restaurants they may or may not have eaten in. I remember
thinking that when I grew up I would never be that boring, that
shallow.
