To my understanding, comedy is a form of entertainment primarily meant to evoke laughter. There are, of course, many other means by which entertainment can be achieved. Off the top of my head, there's suspense, excitement, horror, heartbreak, shock, mild amusement, informative, and physical arousal, aka porn. Sometimes these forms can be combined to create a hybrid type of entertainment. For example, one could conceivably concoct a story that makes the audience laugh, cry, scream, and pause the DVR in order to replay that last bit over and over until they need a Kleenex. My point is, while there are many ways to tell a story, and many purposes to telling them, let's not lose sight of what the categorizing words actually mean. Or, to paraphrase something Sigmund Freud may or may not have said, "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, unless it's in your pants pocket, at which point you can safely call it a schlong."
