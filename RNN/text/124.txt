If you're a regular viewer of Two and a Half Men you've probably noticed that we name each episode with a particularly memorable line of dialogue from that episode. We get a big kick out this. It's fun to do and it frees us from the traditional sitcom drudgery of naming each show with some asinine pun based on a famous movie or song title (e.g. "American Booty," or, "I Can't Get No Masturbation"). The downside of our naming procedure is seen in tonight's episode, entitled "Frankenstein and the Horny Villagers." The title was taken from dialogue in a scene featuring Charlie and Rose. The scene, although wonderfully funny, had to be cut in order to make tonight's show the appropriate length for broadcast.
