That's right. After proofreading tonight's vanity card, I
realized there was no way CBS would air it, so I might as well
censor it myself. Long story short, they gave me so much grief
over material in tonight's episode, I vented my frustration by
writing a card that was not terribly flattering to the network.
People were mentioned by name, etc. As always, should you want to
read the actual card, you know where to look. Just wait until
Mike & Molly is over.
