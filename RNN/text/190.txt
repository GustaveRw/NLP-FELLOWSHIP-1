Dear fellow comedy writers,
As a child of the sixties, I survived being associated with chuck meat, chuck wagons, chucking a ball and a catchy little pop song entitled "The Name Game" ("Sally Sally bo-baly, bananna-fanna fo-fally, fee-fi fo-mally, Sally"). Imagine that rhyming pattern with Chuck and then imagine living through the sixth grade. Later in life I grinned and beared my way through a seemingly endless series of movies about a killer doll named Chucky. Oh, what joy I felt when friends would gleefully point out billboards announcing the sequels, The Bride of Chucky and The Seed of Chucky. And now, there is a spate of film and television projects that have brilliantly re-discovered the humorous use of my name. Beginning with I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, followed by Good Luck Chuck, then a TV series entitled, get ready to laugh, Chuck, a Kelsey Grammer sitcom in which he plays a guy named, get ready to spit milk up through your nose, Chuck Darling, and Pushing Daisies, a supernatural thing which features a pretty female lead named, because it's so damned, freaking funny, Chuck. And if that weren't enough, I recently received a gift of a John Varvatos designer t-shirt inexplicably emblazoned with the phrase Chuck is God. All of which is why I am respectfully requesting a moratorium on the comedic use of my name. I know we're too far down the cultural road to go back to using "Bob," but I'm sure if we put our heads together we can find some suitably funny alternatives. I know it can be done. My first title idea for Dharma & Greg was Dharma & Chuck, but a strong work ethic and a smart writing partner got me past it. See ya on the picket line!
