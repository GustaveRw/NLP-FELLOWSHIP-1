Once again the powers that be have chosen to censor this week's vanity card. Oh well. Comedy, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. If you're still interested in reading the card in question, it exists elsewhere. I hope you think it's pretty. It is definitely sophomoric. If you find it as offensive as the CBS execs who nixed it, I apologize in advance. My goal, as always, was to elicit laughter... and bite the hand that feeds me.
