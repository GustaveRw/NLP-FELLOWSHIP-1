Sometimes I feel like I'm standing on a dock watching Western culture drift away from me like a massive boat. As I imagine it, the people on the deck are not waving goodbye. They're looking away, toward the horizon. The future. And the boat is accelerating. I don't bring this up to generate sympathy. No one threw me overboard. Disembarking was a conscious choice. And so is returning. With a little effort I can take a skiff out to sea and scramble up that gangplank anytime I want. I just have to stop being afraid of Facebook. And Instagram. And Twitter. And LinkedIn. And Tumblr. And Pinterest. And Snapchat. And, well... I guess the Internet. Also, I might need to jettison my love for belabored maritime metaphors.
