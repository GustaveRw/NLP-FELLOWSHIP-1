If you saw our Thanksgiving episode you might have noticed that we had a bit of fun at the expense of Fort Wayne, Indiana. It is my sincere hope that this vanity card will help to unruffle any Hoosier feathers by stating that the only city worthy of comic derision is a city of substance -- a city that was ranked in the nation's top ten to "Earn and Save Money" in the year 2000. A city that was ranked 21st in the top 50 U.S. Best Small Metro Areas for Growing and Starting a Business by Inc. Magazine. A city that, like a rose, smells as sweet when it's called The City of Restaurants, the Gateway to the West, Summit City, City of Churches, The Happiest City, The City That Saved Itself and the All American City. A city that is the birth place of the man without whom there'd be no Honeymooners, no Roots, no I Love Lucy, and no Chuck Lorre Vanity Cards, the inventor of television, Philo T. Farnsworth! And finally, a city that is home to a number of Exec. Producer Bill Prady's relatives. Which, to be perfectly honest, is the main reason we picked Fort Wayne and picked on it. So Bill can go to family re-unions, tell everyone that the episode where Dharma and Greg go on a romantic holiday and get stranded in Fort Wayne was his idea and then "humbly" accept their good-natured, finger-wagging acclaim. Hey, you know what? Why am I doing this? You got a problem with the story, call Prady. But don't bother wagging your finger at him, he gets off on that.
