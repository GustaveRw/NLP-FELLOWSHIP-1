I've been studying up on the psychological phenomenon known as
projection. Sigmund Freud explained it as the mental mechanism by
which a person attributes to others the very qualities he or she
despises, and cannot confront, in themselves. I've also been
learning about passive-aggressive behavior. This is language and
actions that are abusive but cleverly hidden behind a thin veil of
civility. For example, the first two sentences of this vanity
card.
