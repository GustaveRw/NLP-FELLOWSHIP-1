As we go about our day, as we sleep peacefully in our warm beds, a battle is raging. A battle between the forces of darkness and the forces of light, between those who seek chaos and those who cherish and defend order. Many brave and good men have taken on this eternal struggle, but there is only one who has never bent, never hesitated to do what needs to be done. He is a rough, violent man who risks his own soul so that the rest of us may safely live out our lives in ignorant bliss. He seeks no credit. There are no medals, nor parades for men such as he. He fights for us and then, weary and bloodied, he returns to a life of simple anonymity, writing and producing a sitcom for CBS. Who is this soldier? His name does not matter. But you can be sure of one thing, he wouldn't mind a freaking Emmy nomination once in awhile. And he could probably hit evil people on the head with a Golden Globe.
