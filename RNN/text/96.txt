Procrastination is the thief of time. I had a fifth grade teacher named Mr. Penzel who taught me that saying. I never forgot it. I also never put it to good use because here it is Sunday night and this vanity card is due tomorrow. Mr. P also taught me that "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" thing. Of course that saying neglected to mention that throughout my life the one person most likely to fool me would be me, so it too proved to be somewhat limited in its effectiveness. In addition to clever little axioms, Mr. Penzel tried to teach me to think for myself, to have the courage to be unique, to rebel against the status quo. During the height of Beatlemania (and it was most definitely a mania) he mischievously tried to get our class to embrace a "we hate the Beatles" attitude. He failed. But let me tell you, asking a bunch of thirteen-year-olds in 1964 to even consider not being part of a youth phenomenon like the Beatles was as iconoclastic as you could get. It's funny, I don't remember what I ate for breakfast yesterday, but I vividly remember Mr. Penzel, short, dark-haired, almost impish, putting up a new "wise saying" every Monday on the small bulletin board near the door, directly below the clock. It took me thirty-seven years to realize that he put it there because he knew that's where we were looking most of the time.
