One of the great blessings of getting older is realizing, without shame and remorse, what an idiot you've been at earlier stages of your life. I can think of nothing that breeds humility better than this on-going epiphany. The knowledge that with a few exceptions, I was the human version of the "don't pass" bet on a craps table, is oddly comforting. Let's take a look. In 1977 I tried to talk a friend out of investing all his money in stores that only sold running shoes. A few years later, I told anyone who would listen that the female singer of "Lucky Star" was a one-hit wonder, while the singer of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" was here to stay. I saw no future in bottled water or fancy coffee shops. Cellular phones? What for? I already have a phone. And let's not forget that in 1988 I read William Gibson's "Neuromancer," logged onto the Internet, and STILL didn't see it coming. Shall I go on? Shall I share with you some of the moronic things I've done, thought and said in my personal life? Of course I won't. I'm not stupid. I'm just humble.
