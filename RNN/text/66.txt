I've got to share something with you. Every time I write a vanity card, I'm quietly astonished that I get away with putting these things on television every week. I mean think about it, at the end of every episode of Dharma & Greg I get two seconds to communicate whatever's on my mind directly to millions of people. This is a remarkable thing, folks. Secret messages from a sitcom writer using the most powerful medium the world has ever known. Sixty-six cards at two seconds a piece means I've received a total of two minutes and twelve seconds of broadcast time to THINK OUT LOUD. Do you know what that kind of time costs? You don't have to be Bill Gates' building contractor to see that they can't keep letting me get away with this. In fact, just writing this might be some sort of death wish. Number 66, the card that killed the cards. The card that never aired. In years to come, people will talk in hushed tones about the fabled #66. Its very existence will be debated. Did Lorre actually write #66? If he did, was it so inflammatory that the big boys pulled the plug on the whole deal? Could it be that the missing #66 held the vital clue to the puzzle, the enigma, that was Chuck Lorre (graduate thesis, anyone?), or is what happened far more mundane? Number 66 was read by the network censors. They thought it a meandering mixture of hubris and paranoia that lacked a good solid joke at the end, but otherwise containing nothing to merit keeping it off television. One thing's for sure, if you're reading this, you know the answer -- but don't let that discourage you from talking about me in hushed tones.
