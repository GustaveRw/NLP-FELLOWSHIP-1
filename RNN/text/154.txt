WISDOM OF THE AGES


Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters
of Life's longing for itself.
Which is not to say they won't occasionally
break your f#*king heart.
Kahlil Chuck Gibran


There is but one life.
God breathes through the scuttling cockroach
and the soaring hawk.
And yet, I am not a cat person.
Ralph Waldo Lorre


Let's trade Al Michaels for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.
Bob Iger
