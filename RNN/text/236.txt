Mom and Dad are fighting again. I used to think they didn't get along 'cause I wasn't good enough. For years and years I tried to be better, hoping that would make them happy and love each other. But even though I became the most popular kid in my class, they still fight -- now more than ever. God, if you're listening, please make Mom and Dad be nice to each other. I'm too little to make a difference, but you're God, you can do anything -- even help Dad sell off his chain of movie theaters for ten cents on the dollar. Or Showtime. Doesn't matter as long as it's worth forty-nine million dollars and makes Mom stop crying.
