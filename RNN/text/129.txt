There are many impressive-sounding credits at the beginning of every episode of Two and a Half Men. While I do not want to diminish anyone's contribution, I do want to take this opportunity to point out who actually participates in the writing of each and every show. In alphabetical order, and in a ridiculously large, propitiative font, they are: Jeff Abugov (quit Cheers to go to My Two Dads), Lee Aronsohn (a sweet-natured, teddy bear of a man without an original tooth in his head), Susan Beavers (her real name), Don Foster (a bodhisattva in a crappy hat), Eddie Gorodetsky (if you don't know him you might not exist), and Mark Roberts (happily married until his wife finds the secret room where he prays to head shots of Mariska Hargitay). All kidding aside, it's impossible to put a price on the enormity of their individual and collective contributions to the making of the show. I therefore hope that acknowledgements such as this will serve in lieu of cash.
