If you're reading this it means I failed to write a vanity card this week. Early in the season, recognizing that I was bound to miss a deadline sooner or later, I wrote this as sort of an emergency generic card. As such I have no idea when this will air. Which means that I have no clue as to what might have happened or might be happening while you're reading this. So... I'm just gonna have to wing it. First off, I want to congratulate Al Gore on a hard-won victory. What a hoot it was to see the vice-president dance the horah with Tipper at the inauguration. I'm also delighted that I took a deep breath and jumped into the stock market with both feet in August when it hit its all-time low. What a buying opportunity that turned out to be! And how about that Eminem country album, huh? It's a little dark, but man, it's all I've been playing in my car for two weeks now. Needless to say, we all mourn the passing of Howard Stern. And finally, the really big news -- I know I'm going out on a limb here, but what if I'm right? -- who would have thought that we'd finally make contact with an alien race during halftime at the Super Bowl? Boy, that was a shocker. The Jets came back from a four touchdown deficit to pull off the upset of all time. Oh, Howard, I wish you could've been here with us to see it.
