I believe that I suffer from two fundamental forms of fear: fear of not getting what I want, and fear of losing what I have. In that both stem from actual or "perceived" threats to my actual or "perceived" survival, I also believe that both aspects of fear are derived from my underlying fear of my actual or "perceived" death. It would then follow that a good deal of my daily anxiety is a result of my faulty perception. And by faulty perception I mean, "wow, am I a whack job or what?" Which leaves me with only two possible solutions regarding fear -- change my perception, or, failing that, ignore my perception. The reason I bring this up is that in the ever-widening world of self-improvement, I never see "ignoring yourself" offered up as a viable solution to problems of the mind. And yet, it works! Next time your head is filled with anxious thoughts, simply take note of it, thank your mind for trying to ensure your survival, then act as if you just got a stock tip from a homeless person. Of course, ignoring fear messages no longer applies if you're standing in line at the post office and the guy behind you is hiding something beneath a large overcoat and audibly talking to God.
