Many, many, many, many years ago, I had a job as a greens keeper at a little par 3, nine hole golf course. Every morning I'd get up at dawn and drive the tractor-mower up and down the fairways. Then I'd roll the special lawnmower over the greens, trying my best to make them both beautiful and challenging. In my mind, I imagined I was grooming Augusta National. Thinking back I can't help but remember that time as being perfect. My heart was at peace, my work was fulfilling, and each day was a gentle echo of the one before. But I quit that job and moved to Los Angeles because I wanted more. Can you imagine that? I wanted more than a par 27 Walden Pond. Don't get me wrong, I am deeply grateful for the way things turned out. It's just, try as I might, I can't make a sitcom smell like fresh cut grass in the morning.
