I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY THIS WEEK SO I'VE WRITTEN REALLY BIG. I'M HOPING THE SHEER SIZE OF MY WORDS WILL MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF MEANING IN THEM. SOMETIMES BIG CAN BE GOOD. THE GRAND CANYON IS GOOD. SOMETIMES BIG CAN BE BAD. WORLD WARS ARE BAD. I HOPE THIS IS GOOD, LIKE THE GRAND CANYON AND NOT BAD LIKE WAR. OKAY, THAT SHOULD DO IT. BYE, NOW.
