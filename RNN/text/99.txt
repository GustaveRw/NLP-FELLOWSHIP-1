It's funny how writing takes you down roads you never imagined travelling. When I began this vanity card I had what I thought were several sophisticated themes worth delving into. One dealt with the quantum physics discovery that the very act of observing a phenomenon changes the phenomenon. Another explored how I might behave if all my problems were suddenly and mysteriously solved (my contention was that I would obsessively create more problems almost immediately). And still a third premise discussed the always popular ideas of self-love and self-forgiveness. My premise here was that these sorts of concepts are inherently flawed and potentially destructive in that they deal with the individual as something that is split in half: the forgiver and the forgiven, the lover and the beloved. But in the end I managed to abandon all my heady themes the minute I realized the deep personal significance of this card number. I was thirteen years old when "Get Smart" debuted in 1965. I thought it was hilarious and had an immediate and massive crush on Agent 99. To further complicate matters, I was tormented by the knowledge that 99 had a crush on 86 (Maxwell Smart). Thankfully, 86 was moronically oblivious to her affections, so I retained a childish hope that one day she would be mine. Needless to say, my love remained unrequited. But it was not in vain. Thirty-seven years later that innocent boyhood crush would bear fruit as vanity card #99.
