I just turned sixty-five. It is, by any measure, an advanced
age. It is not the new fifty-five, or the new sixty. It is
just old. And it has forced me to do some serious soulsearching,
to ask myself a tough and vaguely frightening
question: How will I know when it's time to quit? What signal,
mental or physical, should I look for that tells me it's time to
stop writing sitcoms? After much careful thought, the answer
came to me. The day I sit on the toilet and my balls hit the
water, I'm done.
