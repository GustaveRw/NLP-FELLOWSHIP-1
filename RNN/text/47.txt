I recently found myself in a room with a group of complete strangers. As each one spoke, I noticed I was making a snap judgement about that person. Sometimes the judgement was warm and appreciative. But more often, it was of the "Geez, what a vacuum tube this guy is" variety. At first I was troubled by this ugly mental reflex. But then I was hit with a flash of insight. As I gazed around the room I realized that if each person was animated by the same energy -- call it God, call it carbon-based, chemical doowhackies -- then each person was essentially life doing the best that it can. Suddenly my judgements were replaced by a pervasive feeling of love. Emboldened by my epiphany, I meditated upon a TV executive with whom I'd recently had difficult relations. I visualized this person not as an arrogant prig, but as "life doing the best that it can." Which is when my insight grew deeper. I now believe that the ability to suspend judgement and flow love works really well with complete strangers.
