I've decided to save everybody a lot of unhappiness and not submit this week's vanity card to the CBS censors (I know when I've crossed the line with these things and don't need a bunch of corporate lawyers getting their cotton blend panties in a bunch). Accordingly, I've banished the offending card to that dark place where all my offending cards go - the internet.
