My name is Larry Sudarkis and my first memories are of the basement. That was my entire world since before I can remember. My mother and father always told me I had to stay down there for my own safety. But I knew that wasn't true. I wasn't locked in that cold, cement-walled room because I was in danger. I was down there because they were afraid of me. They tried to hide their fear, but I could smell it on their skin. The saddest part is they could never bring themselves to tell me they were afraid -- not even the night I drank the life from their warm, lying bodies.
