Fifteen years ago I bumped into Donald Trump. Literally. I wasn't looking where I was going and, I suppose, neither was he. Our collision caused his very large bodyguard to charge toward me in order to neutralize any possible threat to his boss. Now what happened next is why I've never forgotten the incident. Trump quickly looked me up and down and correctly assessed that I posed no danger. With a small, smirking frown and a dismissive little wave, he instantly communicated to his hulking assistant that I should be ignored. The entire incident couldn't have lasted more than ten seconds. No one said, "sorry," or "excuse me," and we all went our separate ways. After all these years, the memory that lingers, the image that haunts, is of his smug pout and condescending hand gesture that somehow caused me to feel utterly insignificant. I was reminded of all this when I looked at the ratings of Two and a Half Men versus the ratings of The Apprentice. Hey, Donald, I just bumped into you again!
