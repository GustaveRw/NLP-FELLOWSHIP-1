Okay, I don't know about you but I'm impressed. Eighty vanity cards! C'mon, that's really something. As a general rule, the only time I ever do anything with the number eighty attached to it is play fifteen holes of golf. But I can now look back with pride on having had the discipline and creativity to communicate something of value eighty times. Now I know some of you are thinking the phrase "something of value" might be overstated. Well, may I remind you, I've always had the option to create a vanity card which had value only to to me (a photo of my dog drinking from the toilet springs to mind). Instead, I chose to wrestle words into some sort of meaningful form... eighty times. Have I been successful? That will have to be determined by people who haven't written eighty vanity cards. What remains indisputable, however, is that the deed is done. Eighty vanity cards can be read, relished, or rejected. I now have something in common with the legendary author, Jules Verne. He wrote a story entitled, Around The World In Eighty Days. I wrote eighty vanity cards. At this rate, it won't be long before I have something in common with secret agent Maxwell Smart's beautiful partner and a lot of bottles of beer on the wall. Oh, that'll be a vanity card to remember.
