I have long believed that if there is a purpose to our existence, it is to bear witness to the mystery and beauty of creation. My thinking, as always, was simple -- a universe unobserved is just a wasted effort. What's a play without an audience? Going forward from that understanding, I further believe that the key ingredient for conscious living is curiosity. What will happen next? Why is this happening now? How does that work? Where did it come from? Where is it going? To be curious is to be in the moment. To be in the moment is to be in a state of grace. And yet, the older I become, the more I'm inclined to look away from what is and seek refuge in my staid ideas of what should be. As a result, my daily challenge is to resist the siren song of nostalgia. I was created to stand in awe and wonderment amidst the spectacle of eternity. And, apparently, to write sitcoms.
