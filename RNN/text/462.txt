When I was a kid I loved to watch The Honeymooners, starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. Some of my favorite childhood memories are sitting with my father and laughing hysterically at these two comic geniuses. There is a scene in tonight's episode of Big Bang where Wolowitz prepares to throw a baseball while his wife watches with growing frustration.�It's an outright steal from classic scenes performed by Gleason and Carney (who probably stole it from Laurel and Hardy, who probably stole it from Euripides). Regardless, I prefer to call it an homage.�Something my dad would've appreciated.
