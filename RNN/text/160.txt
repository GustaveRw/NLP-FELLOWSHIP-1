I want to take this opportunity to say thanks to the greatest crew and production staff on TV. After three years and seventy-two episodes, I'm ashamed to say I still don't know everyone's name or what most of you actually do. The important thing is that you all know me and make half-hearted attempts to suck up. In no particular order, but c'mon, I have to get points for finding a staff list and writing out all your freaking names, thank you to: Tatiana Nell, Mona Garcea, Mike Collier, Joe Bella, Mary Quigley, Maria Pearce, Alissa Neubauer, Carol Anne Miller, Mark Samuels, Marilyn Bagley, Jean Sagal, Steve Silver, Bobby Burton, Bo Miller, Ann Shea, Lee Lee Baird, Toti Levine, Joe Stafford, Marc Peterson, Kathy Nawabi, Jed Linder, Josh Stuart, Jennifer Ullrich, Aundre Johnson, Rhiannon O'Harra, Pat Eyerman, Adria Later, Mark Sweet, Vicky Wright, Missy Nocera, John Shaffner, Francoise Cherry, Matt Russell, Mark Davison, Hunt Hibler, Buzz Jochheim, Brian Brockway, Chris Hinojosa, John Yant, Jamie Hitchcock, Steve Lund, Brian Johnson, Michael Nash, Brian Armstrong, Cleo Terrio, Nigel Stewart, Nikki Valko, Ken Miller, Peter Pappas, Pat Whalen, Mike Smith, Daniel Armstrong, Claude Petty, Scott Dietz, Tom O'Brien, Mike Love, Anne Woodward, Catherine Ridaeaux, Laura Flett, Jeff Kilgore, Noelle Quigley, Susan Turcot, Larry Liddell, Jim Sobiegraj, Tony Vanmeeteren, Trent Anderson, Casey Jones, Sam Arroyo, Janice Berridge, Gabriel Solana, Shelly Woodhouse-Collins, Peggy Nichols, Ralph Abalos, Janice Zoladz - Allison, Lisa Cubero, Terry Dillon, Nicole Eberhardt, Scott Bernstein, David Klein, Aimee McCue, Edward Nedin, Kenny Millen, Sylvia Jahshan, Jennifer Stitz, Jeanette Scheibe, Gabriella Pollino - Rodman, Jim Marchwick, Paul Jimenez, Sammy Medina, Kathy Oldham, Bob Lamasney, Tom Seller, Eric Erickson, Dennis Brown, Grant Geissman, Dennis McElroy, Ahmadu Garba, Ben Bosse, David Saltzman, Roger Abell, Bruce Peters, Michael Rizzolo, Leroy Castelina, Ron Arnold, Terrel Richmond, Dan Berlin, Jim Marshall, Don Johnson, Anne Nevison, Maureen Tamblyn, Kenda Nichols, John Rebber, Jerry Gourre, Ernie Talyor, Shawn Soloman.
