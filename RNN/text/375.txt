I've long known that due to the FCC's equal time rules, I cannot use this space to espouse political views. To do so would set in motion a legal action which demands that an opposing opinion be flashed on the screen for a split second at the end of a sitcom (Iâ€™m guessing). With that in mind, I worked hard to write what I thought was a very balanced, centrist vanity card; a simple, rational essay that no one could disagree with. CBS disagreed.
