According to multiple unnamed sources, sitcom writer/producer Chuck Lorre has been approached by administration officials to step in as Secretary of State. Mr. Lorre could not be reached for comment, but other multiple unnamed sources (Eddie and Nick), insist the 64-year-old comedy writer had no interest in taking Mr. Tillerson's job, seeing as the two men were once "tunnel buddies."
