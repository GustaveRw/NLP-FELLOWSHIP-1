Forgive me if I've been through this before, but I feel it needs repeating: my mind is not my friend. Its ability to look into the environment, perceive "what is" and relate it back to me here at Chuck Central, is depressingly inadequate. As a result, I find myself listening to this sort of interior dialogue: "Hmm, the people I work for want to have a meeting with me on Monday regarding my new script. They probably want to tell me they don't like it. They'll tell me that because they're power-hungry and if they like it they have no power. Power is derived from not liking it and forcing changes. Maybe I should just call them now, tell them I'm sick and tired of the endless politics, and quit. Yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll quit and write movies... that will never be produced. I'll wind up one of those bitter, old guys who sits around the union hall, playing pinochle and complaining about how lousy TV comedy is and how much better it was in my day. So, no, I won't quit, but I won't take any of their stupid notes either. Besides, I don't know how to play pinochle. Here's what I'll do -- I'll be a prima donna. I'll be insanely difficult. Or, better yet, I'll simply roll over and do whatever is asked of me. Covert apathy, that's the ticket! They can't get to you if you don't care! By Monday morning, after a weekend of this sort of cerebral noise, I was ready to lash out at the slightest provocation. "Chuck, would you like some coffee?" "Screw you! I quit!!!" To my great surprise, they like the script. My mouth humbly uttered the words, "Thanks, but it still needs a lot of work," while my mind maliciously whispered to me, "They're lying. Learn to play pinochle."
