Vitreous humour. Apparently that's what I've been seeing in my peripheral vision. My optometrist calls them floaters. He said it happens with age and not to worry about it. I worry about it. Maybe I'd feel better if he told me that what I was seeing was pixies, tiny magical creatures that only appear to a special few. But no, I'm seeing floaters, as in, "Hey Sarge, we just found a floater in the stream." Speaking of streams, I'm due for a general checkup with my MD - which means a prostate exam. I can't wait to hear what descriptive medical term he has for that charming, age-related problem. Probably something technical, like spongy, as in "Hey, Sarge, I spilled my coffee in the squad car. You got any paper towels, or something spongy?"
