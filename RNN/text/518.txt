Dear President Obama,

Even though I am not qualified in any way to be a Supreme Court justice, I would still like to be considered for the open seat. Before you dismiss my request as comic nonsense, I'd like to point out that the current primary race to be POTUS makes very clear that lack of qualifications is an advantage. I don't see why that principle doesnï¿½t also apply to SCOTUS. Please know I'm happy to supply my own robe.

Jurisprudently yours,

Chuck Lorre
