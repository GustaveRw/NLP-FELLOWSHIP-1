Exhausted... can't form sentences... wrapping D&G;, shooting two pilots, moving Mom, learning to dance, planning a wedding... must get help... so tired... can't go on like this... need to sleep... evil secret... hoping for strike... so physically depleted my face hurts... yeah, I know, it hurts you too, ha ha, aren't you clever... seem to get cranky for no reason at all... newfound conviction that I can play piano like Herbie Hancock... bad sign... can't play piano at all... over-using ellipses... Dammit, why is her nose shiny?! Where the hell is makeup?!... Wondering whether I'm paranoid in thinking that an overdue phone call is the first sign of the apocalypse... gleefully looking forward to long plane ride in reclining seat... Dim awareness that all this shall pass... fight or flight... or fandango... uh-oh... language skills slipping away... must finish vanity card before power belt loses charge... must close with joke... knock, knock, who's... oh, dear God, the phone's ringing!
