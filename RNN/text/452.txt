I don't want to write these things anymore. That doesn't mean I won't. It's just, right now, at this particular moment, ech. Enough already. Half the time they're innocuous, the other half they just piss people off. To what end? What's it all about, Alfie? Anyway, sorry to vent. I know this isn't what you wanted to see when you paused your DVR. I wouldn't blame you if you threw your hands up in disgust and went off to read someone else's vanity card. Oh wait, you can't. I'm the only knucklehead who does this. Okay, I feel better. Not better enough to write something worth reading, but certainly good enough to let this one just fizzle out.
