I am continually surprised that someone could posit a surpreme being, a timeless, primal source from which all things emanate, every living creature and every inert piece of matter, every sub-atomic particle and every galaxy, and then insist that such an ineffability could take sides, declaring that it takes one person, or group of persons, over another. But then again, I am continually surprised that someone could be fascinated by American Idol.
