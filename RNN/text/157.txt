Now that the networks are eagerly exploring new income opportunities via dvd packages and internet downloads, I thought it might be time for me to start looking at ways to mine my vanity card as a potential revenue stream (I love saying "revenue stream." Not having an MBA, it conjures up an image of a large, green cartoon character peeing money.). Anyway, since this card represents one second of weekly prime-time exposure, not to mention re-runs, downloads and dvd sales, some national advertisers might want to start talking to me about the soft drinks I enjoy, the cars I covet, the cholesterol-busting drugs I take, the golf balls I hit in the water, the cell phone service that constantly drops my calls, the airlines that treat me like cattle, the satellite car radio I got as a birthday gift that loses the damn signal every time I drive in a canyon or past a tall building, etc. See how it works? I can like your product, or not. It all depends on how much you like me. Too subtle? Okay, let's try this approach. You have a very nice, publicly-traded, multi-national corporation and we wouldn't want anything to happen to it... now would we? I'll be in touch.
