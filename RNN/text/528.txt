My World of Wonder
Part one

Sometimes I wonder why the editorial staff at Vanity Fair thinks I care about the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Sometimes I wonder why scissors only work in my right hand.

Sometimes I wonder why Elton John thought �Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting� when he probably was gonna get his ass kicked.

Sometimes I wonder why I'm always putting my t-shirt on backwards when there's a fifty-fifty chance I'll get it right.

Sometimes I wonder why people vote against their self-interest.

Sometimes I wonder why I vote against my self-interest.

Sometimes I wonder why people who believe in an omnipotent, allknowing, eternal and infinite God of love can be angry.

Sometimes I wonder if my dog is purposely messing with me.

Sometimes I wonder if my mind hates me.

Sometimes I wonder if fast-forwarding through commercials makes me a traitor to my cause.

Sometimes I wonder who - who wrote the book of love.
