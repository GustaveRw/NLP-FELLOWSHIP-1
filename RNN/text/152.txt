As I write this I'm moments away from pitching an idea for a new comedy series to the president of CBS, Leslie Moonves. I've done this before and it's always an anxiety-producing experience. Months of work can evaporate in seconds if he does not respond favorably. To make matters worse, I always know when I'm getting a negative response because Les has what poker players call a subtle "tell." When he doesn't like something he frowns. Many of the people who work for him are familiar with this tell. When they see it they respond with a tell of their own -- they start examining their shoes as if they've never seen them before. Anyway, I have to go to the meeting now, keep your fingers crossed!.... Okay, I'm back and I think it went fairly well (no perceivable tell). I did make an amateur mistake by telling Les that he and I drive the same cool car, but he didn't seem to hold it against me. He and his team were courteous, pleasant and appropriately cautious. They ended the meeting by saying they looked forward to seeing a finished script before making a final decision... hold on, my cell phone is ringing... That was Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers TV. Apparently moments after we left the building, Les told his execs he liked the idea and to move forward on it. Our project has received a green light! In a matter of seconds my anxiety about pitching it has transmuted into anxiety about writing, casting, shooting, editing, waiting to find out if it gets on the Fall schedule, and, if it does, juggling two shows, promotion, staffing, time slots and ratings -- not to mention worrying about whether Les will be pissed off when he reads this vanity card.
