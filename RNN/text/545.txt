I don't know about you, but I've been spending most of my free time
in the land of Not Yet. If you're unfamiliar with it, Not Yet is a
happy place where all the bad things that seem likely to occur have
not happened... yet. I like to think of it as a shimmering,
shivering soap bubble whose fragile beauty is only made greater by
the knowledge that it will soon burst, making way for the dark
realm of You Gotta Be Kidding Me.
