I'm thinking of running for Sheriff of Los Angeles County. I have no qualifications but perhaps I could use that as an asset. (In a debate I could say that as far as law enforcement is concerned, I have an unblemished record.) And I could add levity to the proceedings. Maybe run on a platform that emphasizes the need for heavily armed robot cops. My campaign slogan would be, "Robots With Guns! What Could Go Wrong?" I'm also mulling the congressional seat recently opened by the retirement of Henry Waxman. Again, I think my complete lack of experience is a selling point. I'm also a big fan of incompetent government, as the overly organized ones tend to put people like me on trains to Poland. For this elective office I'm thinking I need a campaign slogan that alienates no one. Something along the lines of, "Send me to Congress and watch what happens!"
