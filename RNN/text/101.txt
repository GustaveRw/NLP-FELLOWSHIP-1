The following are my opening remarks in a speech I made at a fund-raising dinner for a free clinic in Los Angeles. As I began speaking I could hear the audience gasp at the darkness of my story (a true story by the way). Thankfully, when I arrived at the end, the somber mood was broken. I hope it has the same effect as a vanity card. "In 1976, when I was very ill with ulcerative colitis, weighed 120 pounds and was without any health insurance, I went to the old Cedars of Lebanon hospital and was given free medical attention by allowing myself to be what was essentially a lab rat for their teaching program. What I didn't know at the time, was that the incredible pain and humiliation of receiving a colonoscopy in front of a classroom of medical students was perfect preparation for writing and producing 'Roseanne', 'Grace Under Fire' & 'Cybill'. It's good I spoke after dinner, isn't it?"
