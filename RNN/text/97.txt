Sitting on my desk are several week's worth of show biz trade papers. On the cover of each paper is a request that I consider an actor or movie for an Oscar nomination. The ones I find most touching are Reese Witherspoon, best actress for Legally Blonde, and Drew Barrymore, best actress for Riding in Cars with Boys. In Drew's ad, Gene Shallit of the Today Show calls her "a meritorious actress," while in Reese's ad, Susan Wloszczyna of the NY Observer says she "serves justice in delicious fashion." That, my friends, is high praise indeed. Personally, I hope they're both nominated, and then tie for the win. That way no one's feelings will be hurt, Mr. Shallit and Ms. Wloszczyna's plaudits will not have been in vain, and Oscar night will be truly memorable.
