When I was in second grade I brought home a report card with mediocre grades and a handwritten comment from my teacher saying I was the class clown, and perhaps I needed to get more attention at home. My father complied by giving me a little whack on the back of the head and telling me to quit being a jackass. He then turned on the TV, put his arm around me, and we watched The Honeymooners.

Lesson learned.
