On behalf of the producers of The Big Bang Theory I want to take this opportunity
to thank our intrepid office staffers: Jen D'Angelo, Anthony Robinson, Jess
Ambrosetti, Gary Torvinen, Tara Hernandez, Charlie Back, Robin Green for their
tireless efforts and ridiculous devotion to the building of the Lego Death Star
seen in tonight's episode. You are all now part of television history, although that
will not be reflected in your paycheck.
