When someone loves you, do you really feel their love? To feel their love you'd have to assume that there are 'love particles' (or waves) that radiate from person to person. If you believe that then you'd have to believe that movie stars are constantly bombarded by a warm, fuzzy feeling as a result of the worldwide emanations of love flowing toward them. Trust me, they feel bombarded, but not by the warm and the fuzzy. Or try this: When you look at your beloved and feel that special feeling, does your beloved look up from their oatmeal and realize they're the lucky recipient of your love? It is my contention that if they did look up, the only thing they'd realize is that there's a big gob of oatmeal on their pajamas. I would also contend that their only inkling that you love them is when you smile and say, "Honey, would you like me to make you some oatmeal?" And that wouldn't actually be feeling love as much as inferring love (she cooked me oatmeal, she smiled at me, my mother cooked me oatmeal, my mother smiled at me, my mother said she loved me, ergo she loves me). My guess is that when you're feeling loved, what you're actually feeling is the love you have for the other person. That's good news, right? If all we ever wanted was to be loved, the key to that love was in our hands the entire time. To feel love, give love. Simple. Or, if you prefer, spend all your time becoming famous so you can be bombarded with 'love particles' while you're checking into a rehab facility in the desert.
