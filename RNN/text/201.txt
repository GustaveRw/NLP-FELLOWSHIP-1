The Four Formless States of Consciousness
in Buddhism

AKASANANTYAYATANA: We become limitless space. 

VIJNANANANTYAYATANA: We reach the state of limitless consciousness. 

AKINCANYAYATANA: We meditate on the non-distinction between the knower and the known. 

NAIVASANJNANASANJNAYATANA: We become the state of neither perception nor non-perception. 

Just thought you should know so that when you achieve these states you'll know what to tell your friends.
