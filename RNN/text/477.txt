As I mentioned a few episodes ago, I'm no longer writing vanity cards. Going forward I plan on experimenting with different ideas to replace them. The next two can be seen following tonight's episodes of Mom and Two and a Half Men. I'd very much like to get your input before I make a final decision. Perhaps we can have some sort of online vote. Of course those of you who follow the cards hoping to find something to hate are certainly welcome to continue on in that manner.
