For the sake of my mental health I am taking a break from watching TV news. I am also avoiding newspapers and news websites. I am, for better or worse, sticking my head in the sand. I have no choice. Continued engagement with current events is just too painful. I will instead fill my time with friends, family, music, meditation, golf, novels, sports and movies. And yes, I could be accused of apathy, of being a sulky sore loser. And perhaps I am. I don't care. I need some time to regroup. To allow my grief and revulsion to morph into something positive. Something productive. Sitting around and worrying about the global rise of fascism is so 1938.
