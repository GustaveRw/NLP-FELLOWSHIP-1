Sometimes I wake up from a dream with what feels like a perfect opening sentence for a novel. This morning I excitedly scrambled out of bed and wrote down the following:

"Penelope Fumblegarden was an extraordinary woman."

I tried to go back to sleep to find that all-important second sentence, but the only words that floated into my consciousness were, "I have to pee. I don't have to pee. No, I really do. Wait... okay, I'm fine. Aw, dammit, I gotta go!"
