In the past, this is where I'd normally post my silly holiday
greeting vanity card. �Not this year. �No, this year I have
achieved a state of exhaustion that I've never known before. �This
year I have managed to completely burn myself out. �The phrase
"words fail me" has suddenly become deeply and frighteningly
meaningful. If the part of the dying Tinker Bell in Peter Pan was
played by a middle-aged, Jewish sitcom writer, you'd have an
accurate picture of where I'm at right now. �My light is dimming.
I am a husk. �A husk of a hack. �There's nothing left to say.
Farewell. �Tell my children I love them.
