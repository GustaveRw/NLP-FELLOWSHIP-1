I've come to realize that my vanity cards are the perfect vehicle to explore the vainest thing imaginable, the ego. The illusory self. The mind-made, compulsively thinking entity that usurped the mantle of "I" from the eternal and infinite consciousness from which it sprang. The never-satisfied ghost in the machine that believes itself to be separate from the rest of creation and exists in a constant state of dread because it knows it is temporal, a phantasm. In other words, "I think therefore I am" is false. "I am that I am" is true. Now I just have to figure out how to turn this into a sitcom. My working title is either "Hey, Eckhart!" or "For Whom the Tolle Tolls."
