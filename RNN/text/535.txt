In an effort to encourage transparency among those who seek high
office, I am releasing my dogï¿½s medical records. As you can see
he is receiving acupuncture and taking prednisone for his
arthritic knees. This is helping him get on and off the couch.
Regardless, he is perfectly fit to serve as my dog.
