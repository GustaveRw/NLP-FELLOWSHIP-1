CENSORED

As always, the offending material is available to be read if you know where to look. I think you'll find that the card, while mildly amusing, is nowhere near as entertaining as the raging paranoia of our network censors. 

P.S. For selfish reasons I would ask that you wait to read the censored card until after The Big Bang Theory.
