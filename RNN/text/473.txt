The other night I woke up at three in the morning with a powerful urge to, how can I say this delicately... void my bladder. Barely awake, I stumbled into the bathroom, lifted the seat, then, for reasons we can only call stupid, decided I was too sleepy to stand. So I sat down and fell into the toilet. Shocked by the ass splashdown, I leaped up, slammed my head against the door, stumbled backwards, ripped the phone off the wall - yes, I have a phone in there - then stuck the landing with one foot in the magazine basket and the other in the toilet. The next morning I considered using my nocturnal mishap in a sitcom, but decided against it because I didn't think anyone would believe it.
