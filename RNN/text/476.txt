I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the folks at CBS for putting Mike & Molly back on the air. I'd also like to thank all our loyal viewers. You've waited a long time for our return and I hope your patience is rewarded with laughter. And finally, I'd like to thank my parents - may God rest their souls. Mom, Dad, you're both with me every step of the way - whether I like it or not.
