I'm embarrassed to admit this, but there's a certain perverse
attraction to witnessing the death of truth and with it, the end of
democracy. It's like a macro version of slowing down to see a car
crash. But in this case the adrenaline rush comes from watching a
herpetic flimflam artist shock the history monkey. And just to
make it even more titillating, our best hope to save the day is an
eighty year-old slab of beef jerky from Arizona and his trusty
sidekick, Scarlett O'Hara.
