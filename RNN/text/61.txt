When I was a little kid my parents often used a phrase that, to their way of thinking, described the ancient art of meditation. The phrase was "staring at one's belly button." This bon mot was most often used to describe someone who was sitting on their butt practicing the equally ancient art of underachieving. "Look at that guy over there staring at his belly button," would be considered an acceptable use of this witticism. Another common remark heard in my formative years was "He's got a head on his shoulders," which was used to express admiration and respect. Smart people who were doing something with their lives had "heads on the shoulders." Those who were not quite so clever, well, there was another phrase for where their heads were. The reason I'm bringing this up is that while meditating recently I had a tremendous flash of insight -- I have never stared at my belly button, not while meditating, not while underachieving, and my head has always been on my neck. When I mentioned to my mother that my head was filled with these sorts of nonsensical sayings and I considered it a subtle form of child abuse, she told me not to be such a Wisenheimer. Wisenheimer was an old country name that was later anglicized to Smartypants.
