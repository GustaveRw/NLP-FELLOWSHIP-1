In an early draft of the very first episode of Dharma & Greg, Dharma's last name was Lowenstein; Greg had an angry and neurotic sister named Penny; Greg's father was romantically involved with a beautiful Swedish au pair named Gjerta; Greg's mother was a lush; Dharma's best friend was named Veronica; Dharma and Greg never go to a baseball game or Reno for pie but they do go to a local coffee shop where they deal with a sarcastic waitress named Connie who has every laugh in the scene; Dharma nobly offers Greg an annulment; Dharma's dad tries to convince some policemen that the pot on his property is not his (and if it was it would be legal since he has glaucoma); and finally, Greg arrives to refuse the annulment and save Mr. Lowenstein. I bring this up as a way of reminding myself that I get deeply attached to things I write (in this case co-write) and become fiercely resistant to change, even though I know from experience that every thing I've ever done got better with each successive draft. Taken a step further, perhaps this obsessive drive to protect an early draft is a microcosmic view of the struggle to resist evolution on a macro scale. Perhaps the struggle to resist is an essential part of the process. Perhaps the human race is merely an early draft, a minor blip in an inexorable and endless process of cosmic re-writes. But I digress. Gjerta? Whoa, what were we thinking?
