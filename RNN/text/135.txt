I was recently interviewed by a tabloid reporter who was writing a story based on information he was given by "informed sources". He told me that he knew the information was false. When I asked why he'd bother to continue with the story, he said, "Well, I have informed sources." I said, "Yes, but you know that those informed sources are, at best, misinformed, or, at worst, lying." To which he replied, "That's why your comments are good for the story. They give it balance." Need I say more?
