I recently pierced the veil of a long-standing delusion which I had considered to be reality. The delusion was simply this: I thought people were deeply aware of me. I thought the things going on in my life -- my work, relationships, problems, joys, thoughts, insights, attitudes, tastes, desires, fears, good hair days, bad hair days, choice of pants (that's right, choice of pants), etc. ad delusium, were all of some significance to other people. I'm not certain, but I think the delusion is a twisted sort of family heirloom, a neurotic hand-me-down of the fiercely-held immigrant desire to fit in, to be acceptable. Be that as it may, the impact of this hallucination has been a constant state of low-grade anxiety. While it's still a little early to tell, it appears that freedom from it will create an enormous sense of relief and... well... freedom. You people out there, kind and considerate though you may be, don't really give a rat's ass about my life. You give a rat's ass about your life. This means I need no longer obsess over what others think of me (they don't). This means that I am, much to my amazement, more or less invisible. But most importantly, this means that I can begin living a fearless, delusion-free life that is fundamentally true to my basic, God-given nature. All that's left to do is discover what kind of pants my basic, God-given nature looks good in.
