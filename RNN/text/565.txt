I was listening to the Beatles channel on satellite radio when
World War III started. Knowing the end was near, I sat in my
car, fully expecting to hear The End, or All Things Must Pass.
I got Octopus's Garden instead. As the roiling nuclear inferno
swept across the Los Angeles basin, my last thought was of my
father and his stubborn unwillingness to appreciate the crucial
role Ringo played in the Fab Four.
