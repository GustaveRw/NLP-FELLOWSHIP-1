Tonight's episode was about Charlie being drugged and imprisoned by his stalker, Rose. In addition, we did jokes about nasal spray being an effective aid for love-making, a young boy's desire to go to a strip bar, a mother cavalierly assuming that her son has some sort of third-world venereal disease, a Korean woman suffocating from the toxic fumes she inhales painting the toe nails of a "white she-bitch," stalking the British Royal Family, a woman holding a man's penis while he urinates, two men being interrupted while defecating, suppositories as a barbiturate delivery system, and finally, a hooker used to purposely transmit a viral infection. But the joke that we could not put in the show tonight, the one comic moment that CBS Broadcast Standards absolutely refused to bend on, was a harmless bit of word play which required the mention of a name-brand hard liquor. When I asked why, I was told it's against CBS corporate policy. I desperately wanted a drink.
