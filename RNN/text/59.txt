A friend of mine recently asked me if I was responsible for any of the countless jokes that are told in offices and homes throughout the country. His question certainly had a valid premise. One would assume that comedy writers write jokes. Following that line of reason he thought, well, Chuck's a comedy writer (remember, he's my friend), ergo Chuck must write some of these "a guy goes into a bar with a duck on his head" deals. Well, I had to tell him that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I've sat in many rooms with many talented comedy writers and every one of them was as mystified as I was as to the origin of jokes. What wonderful madman writes "a pig this good you don't eat all at once?" What evil genius cooked up the comic recipe for "I feel good, but I look awful?" I don't know. But if you're out there and you dreamed up "You want me to numb that for you, Mrs. Johnson?", thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
