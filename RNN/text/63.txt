Here's a funny thing. I've been trying to create a sympathetic male character in his early twenties for another project I'm working on. After struggling with a variety of generic, off-the-rack prototypes, I thought why not use myself as a template (at least myself as I was in my early twenties) -- which is where the funny part comes in. When I began using an autobiographical approach I discovered -- to my horror -- that I don't find the "young me" to be a particularly sympathetic character. Needless to say, this sort of thinking brings to light all kinds of personal issues I don't really feel are appropriate for a vanity card. But the question remains, what does it mean when you reflect on your life and find that you didn't make a very good hero? Your actions were either self-serving, thoughtless, shallow, craven, vain, vengeful, manipulative or, when you really got it going, all of the above. Well, it means that even though we go through life thinking of ourselves as the leading man, the truth is some of us are better cast as mischief-making sidekicks. Or, in a few cases, unwitting villains who have to learn to forgive themselves. Regardless, I've decided not to take any chances. I'm basing my sympathetic male character on a young Tom Hanks.
