Hi! Welcome back to season two of Mom. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for watching. As you can probably tell from the first episode, we're trying to push the envelope a little. Sitcom families don't normally get evicted and end up living in a motel. Maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe sitcoms exist only to portray the sunny side of American life. We'll find out soon enough. If you're not back to watch next week, we'll know we should have opened the season with a story about the little boy getting in trouble at school for showing his friends embarrassing pictures of his sister, causing his mom all kinds of headaches and oh, please come back next week.
