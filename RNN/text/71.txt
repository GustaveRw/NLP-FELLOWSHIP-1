Interesting Dharma & Greg facts: In the first draft of the first script Greg had a teenage sister who was a pyromaniac. Also in that script was a scene where Dharma's dad was about to be arrested for plants growing on his property that he swore did not belong to him -- while at the same time insisting he had a prescription for glaucoma. The first time I met Jenna was at a breakfast meeting. I ate before she arrived so she wouldn't see what a sloppy eater I was. The original inspiration for these vanity cards came from exec producer Bill Prady, who has also edited each and every one. There's no way I can confirm this, but I suspect Bill might be the smartest man in the world (edit that, buddy). In the first episode exec producer Don Foster came up with the immortal lines for Dharma, "Comb your frog," and, "Drive your coffee table to Idaho." I can't confirm this either, but I suspect Don might be a bodhisattva, a fully-realized soul who has voluntarily returned to the physical plane to help lesser souls achieve spiritual freedom. The actual premise of D&G was inspired by the Bruce Springsteen song "She's the One" on Born to Run (which has one of the great Bo Diddley riffs of all time). The first time I heard the word dharma was in 1968. The debut Jethro Tull album, (a killer album by the way, far superior to Aqualung) had a song entitled "Dharma for One." For the next twenty-five years I didn't know what the word meant. Now I do.
