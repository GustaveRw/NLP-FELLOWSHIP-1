People often ask me, "Chuck, where do the ideas for Two and a Half Men come from?" Well, the answer is very simple. Tonight's show, for instance, was inspired by many of the great films that have been out recently. Two handsome young cowboys share a hidden love that society condemns. A love that torments them and presumably requires a lot of lubrication. A brilliant homosexual author is not tormented about being homosexual but drinks a lot and is tormented while writing a book about tormented men who have killed people. A brilliant and tormented country singer is tormented until he stops drinking and finds the love of a good woman who is not tormented. A brilliant TV news man is tormented by his moral obligation to stand up against a tormented bully. A spy is tormented by the corruption and deceit that lies beneath the politics of oil (a lubricant). A cross-section of Los Angelenos are tormented by the endless cycle of racism that lies beneath the surface of Los Angeles. An Israeli soldier is tormented by the endless cycle of violence that lies above the surface of the Middle East. And finally, a big monkey is tormented because he loves a really small woman, who, if their love were to proceed, no amount of lubricant would help. Now, if you go back and review tonight's episode you'll see that both Charlie and Alan were tormented. See how it works? The lubrication stuff we're saving for sweeps.
