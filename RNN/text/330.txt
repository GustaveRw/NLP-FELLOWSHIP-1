He felt dead inside.

No matter how hard he partied, he could never escape that simple
fact - inside, dead.

And that was his life.

Running from a feeling.

At least until he could run no more.

Exhausted, spent and beaten, when the end finally came, he
welcomed it.

With life ebbing from his wasted body, he was suddenly swept up in
a transcendent state of joy that was pure and complete.

Moments later he felt dead inside.
