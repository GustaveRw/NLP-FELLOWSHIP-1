YOU MUST READ THIS VANITY CARD! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S SACRED, YOU MUST READ THIS VANITY CARD!! Well, actually, you really don't have to. I just wanted to start the card off with some excitement. To tell you the truth, now I feel a little guilty. After all, aren't we misled enough in this life without having to be duped into reading a Chuck Lorre Productions Vanity Card? Isn't our attention vitally needed at home, at the job, with our children, husbands, wives, parents, and friends? Shouldn't we be using this precious time to call our hermaphroditic, cross-addicted cousin and talk him into giving himself up to the authorities? Wouldn't it be better for all of us if these golden, never-to-come-again moments were used to sneak into work after everyone has gone and take that stupid nanny-cam out of the ladies room? Well, we might as well face it, that's not going to happen now. And all because of two completely duplicitous sentences: YOU MUST READ THIS VANITY CARD! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S SACRED, YOU MUST READ THIS VANITY CARD!! What was I thinking? I'm so ashamed.
